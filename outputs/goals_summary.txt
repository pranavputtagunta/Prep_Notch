Okay, I think I have all the information needed.

INFORMATION_COMPLETE

**Goal:** Build a four-function calculator app in Python within the next week, dedicating about one hour per day to the project, to learn basic Python.

**Motivation:** To learn basic Python.

**Success:** Having a command-line calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Project Setup (Day 1):**
    *   Sub-tasks:
        *   Install Python (if not already installed).
        *   Create a new Python file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
        *   Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
    *   Dependencies: None
    *   Required Skills: Basic computer skills, familiarity with command line (optional)
    *   Deadline: End of Day 1
2.  **Input Handling (Day 2):**
    *   Sub-tasks:
        *   Prompt the user to enter the first number.
        *   Prompt the user to enter the operation (+, -, \*, /).
        *   Prompt the user to enter the second number.
        *   Store the inputs in variables.
    *   Dependencies: Project Setup
    *   Required Skills: Basic Python syntax, input/output operations
    *   Deadline: End of Day 2
3.  **Calculation Logic (Day 3):**
    *   Sub-tasks:
        *   Create functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
        *   Implement the calculation logic within each function.
    *   Dependencies: Input Handling
    *   Required Skills: Basic Python syntax, arithmetic operations, functions
    *   Deadline: End of Day 3
4.  **Error Handling (Day 4):**
    *   Sub-tasks:
        *   Check for division by zero.
        *   Handle invalid operator input.
        *   Handle non-numeric input.
    *   Dependencies: Calculation Logic
    *   Required Skills: Conditional statements (if/else), error handling (try/except)
    *   Deadline: End of Day 4
5.  **User Interface (Day 5):**
    *   Sub-tasks:
        *   Display the result of the calculation.
        *   Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.
    *   Dependencies: Error Handling
    *   Required Skills: Basic Python syntax, input/output operations
    *   Deadline: End of Day 5
6.  **Testing and Debugging (Day 6):**
    *   Sub-tasks:
        *   Test the calculator with various inputs.
        *   Fix any bugs that are found.
    *   Dependencies: User Interface
    *   Required Skills: Problem-solving, debugging
    *   Deadline: End of Day 6
7.  **Wrap up and final testing (Day 7):**
    *   Deadline: End of Day 7

**Time Commitment:** Approximately 1 hour per day for 7 days.
